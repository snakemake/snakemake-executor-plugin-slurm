            Beep, Beep - I am your friendly #Snakemake release announcement bot.
            
            There is a new release of the Snakemake executor for #SLURM on #HPC systems. Its version now is {{ version }}!
            
            Give us some time, and you will automatically find the plugin on #Bioconda and #Pypi.
